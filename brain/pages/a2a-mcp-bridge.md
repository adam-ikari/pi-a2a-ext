# A2A MCP Bridge — Key Decisions

Goal: an omp extension (pi-a2a-ext) turns the running omp into a Streamable HTTP MCP server so a remote omp can call the host's live tools without the host invoking any LLM API.

## Q1 Execution target (decided)
Remote tools/call executes IN the host's live session via AgentRegistry.global().get("Main").session.getToolByName(name).execute(...). No headless subprocess for v1.

## Q2 Transport (decided — supersedes early "stdio" note)
Streamable HTTP on 127.0.0.1 via Bun.serve, single process inside the host omp. stdio was rejected: a stdio MCP server needs exclusive stdin/stdout which collides with the running TUI, and TUI approval forwarding requires same-process. Verified against host client: protocol 2025-11-25, Accept: application/json, text/event-stream; plain JSON responses suffice; GET SSE optional (405 tolerated); notifications accept 200/202 (src/mcp/transports/http.ts).

## Q3 Approval (decided)
Reuse the host's built-in approval gate. Registry tools ARE ExtensionToolWrapper instances (sdk.ts:2922) which run resolveApproval internally: yolo passes, per-tool prompt raises ui.select in the host TUI, no-UI modes fail closed. The bridge must inject the REAL session.settings and the ExtensionContext ui into the AgentToolContext it builds; it implements no approval logic itself.

## Q4 Exposure (decided)
pi.getAllTools() -> full tool list (name/description/parameters via toolWireSchema -> JSON Schema 2020-12), config deny list removes tools from both tools/list and tools/call. No whitelist in v1.

## Q5 Auth (decided)
Static Bearer token, 32 random bytes base64url, generated on first start, persisted 0600 in ~/.omp/agent/a2a-bridge.json together with port/host/deny. Constant-time compare. /a2a rotate regenerates. No OAuth/TLS in v1 (loopback default; SSH forwarding documented).

## Notable verified facts
- MCP SDK not installed anywhere: bridge hand-writes JSON-RPC on Bun.serve, zero deps.
- AgentToolContext required fields (sessionManager/modelRegistry/model/isIdle/hasQueuedMessages/abort) are all reachable from public surfaces: AgentSession.settings/.sessionManager/.modelRegistry/.model + ExtensionContext ui/hasUI/isIdle/hasPendingMessages/abort.
- Main is registered into AgentRegistry.global() by createAgentSession in ALL modes (sdk.ts:1745,3321), so tools/call works in TUI and headless alike (headless prompt tier fails closed when policy requires UI).
- Host MCP client pages tools/list with do-while on nextCursor (mcp/client.ts:233); omitting nextCursor is valid.
